### about my project

my project is about dominos pizza, it has some facts about how many
stores it has around the world and about how many countrys it is in.

it also provides a few pictures and videos of the pizzas they make,
the logo etc. the website also provides a te reo maori version of the
facts and the home page.

### my design process

- layout
  -the layout i chose was chosen because it it is simple but easy to know where to go
- colour
  -the colours i have chosen as the backround were chosen because they went best with the pictures in my opinion.
- font(s)
  -the fonts i used where easy to read(in my opinion)
- videos
  - the videos showed a bit about two pizzas being made and the front of a store.
