### about my project

My project is about dominos pizza, it has some facts about how many
stores it has around the world and about how many countrys it is in.

It also provides a few pictures and videos of the pizzas they make,
the logo etc. The website also provides a Te Reo Maori version of the
facts and the home page.

### my design process

- Colour
  * The colours i have chosen as the backround were the best as they fit lots of the pictures (in my opinion)
  * The **website** i used for this is [**colorexplorer.com**](http://www.colorexplorer.com/imageimport.aspx)
- videos
  * The videos showed a bit about two pizzas being made and the front of a store.
- pictures
  * The pictures i put in the website were put there because they showed some appitizing pizzas, the logo of the store and the front of the store.
- layout
  * This is the layout of the homepage.
